        <p>A solar tracking system adjusts the angle and orientation of solar panels to track the sun's movement, maximizing energy output. It consists of solar panels, tracking mechanism, control system, sensors, and actuators. Benefits include increased energy output, improved efficiency, reduced land requirements, and increased reliability. However, challenges include higher cost, increased complexity, maintenance requirements, and environmental factors. Solar tracking systems are used in utility-scale solar farms, commercial and industrial solar installations, residential solar installations, and Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) systems.  </p>
